# Testing Guide for RTI Connector Go

## Available Testing Methods

### 1. Using Makefile (Recommended)

The project includes a Makefile with proper library path configuration:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage and race detection
make test-local

# Run tests in Docker container
make test

# Run linting (requires golangci-lint)
make lint-local
```

### 2. Manual Testing Commands

```bash
# Build all packages
go build ./...

# Run code quality checks
go vet ./...
go fmt ./...

# Run tests with manual library path setup
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=rticonnextdds-connector/lib/osx-arm64 go test -v

# Build examples
cd examples/simple/writer && go build writer.go
cd examples/simple/reader && go build reader.go
```

### 3. Using the Test Script (Recommended for Development)

Run the comprehensive test script that validates all improvements:

```bash
./test_improvements.sh
```

This script runs:
- Build verification for all packages
- Code quality checks (`go vet`, formatting)
- Full unit test suite with coverage
- Example application builds
- Test coverage analysis

## Test Coverage

The current test suite achieves **84.6% code coverage** with the following tests:

- ✅ Connector creation and deletion
- ✅ Input/Output validation
- ✅ Data flow testing
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Publisher-Subscriber matching
- ✅ Error handling scenarios

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS (Apple Silicon)
- Uses `osx-arm64` libraries
- Library path: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=rticonnextdds-connector/lib/osx-arm64`

### macOS (Intel)
- Uses `osx-x64` libraries
- Library path: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=rticonnextdds-connector/lib/osx-x64`

### Linux
- Uses `linux-x64` or `linux-arm64` libraries
- Library path: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=rticonnextdds-connector/lib/linux-x64`
