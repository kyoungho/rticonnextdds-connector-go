### RTI Connector for Connext DDS
*RTI Connector* for Connext DDS is a quick and easy way to access the power and
functionality of [RTI Connext DDS](http://www.rti.com/products/index.html).
It is based on [XML-Based Application Creation](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/xml_application_creation/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_XML_AppCreation_GettingStarted.pdf) and Dynamic Data.

*Connector* was created by the RTI Research Group to quickly and easily develop demos
and proofs of concept. It can be useful for anybody that needs
a quick way to develop an application communicating over the Connext DDS Databus.
Thanks to the binding with multiple programming languages, you can integrate
with many other available technologies.

The *Connector* library is provided in binary form for [select architectures](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector/tree/master/lib). Language bindings and examples are provided in source format.

Go *Connector* leverages [cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo) to call its C library;
this detail is hidden in a Go wrapper. 

### Getting started
RTI Go Connector requires [Git LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) to check out the Connector C library files properly. 

```bash
$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
$ sudo apt-get install git-lfs
$ git lfs install
```

Be sure you have golang installed (we tested with golang v1.10 above). 

Install:
```bash
$ go get github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector-go
```

Import:
```golang
import "github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector-go"
```

Please see [examples](examples/README.md) for usage details.

### Static Build
To build your application statically, it requires RTI Connext DDS static libs (```libnddscorez.a```, ```libnddscz.a```). They are located in ```$NDDSHOME/lib/YOUR_ARCHITECTURE```. 

```bash
$ cp $NDDSHOME/lib/YOUR_ARCHITECTURE/libnddscorez.a ./static_lib/YOUR_ARCHITECTURE/
$ cp $NDDSHOME/lib/YOUR_ARCHITECTURE/libnddscz.a ./static_lib/YOUR_ARCHITECTURE/
```

Then, you can run ```go build``` with ```-tags static``` to build. 
```bash
$ go build -tags static ./examples/simple/writer/writer.go
```

### Platform support
Go *Connector* builds its library for few [select architectures](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector/tree/master/lib). If you need another architecture, please contact your RTI account manager or sales@rti.com.

If you want to check the version of the libraries you can run the following command:

``` bash
strings librtiddsconnector.so | grep BUILD
```

### Threading model
The *Connector* Native API does not yet implement any mechanism for thread safety. Originally, the *Connector* native code was built to work with *RTI Prototyper* and Lua. That was a single-threaded loop. RTI then introduced support for JavaScript, Python, and Go. For now, you are responsible for protecting calls to *Connector*. Thread safety
may be implemented in the future.

### Support
*Connector* is an experimental RTI product. If you have questions, please use the [RTI Community Forum](https://community.rti.com/forums/technical-questions). If you would like to report a bug or have a feature request, please create an [issue](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector-go/issues).

### Documentation
The best way to get started with *Connector* is to look at the
examples; you will see that it is very easy to use.

Please see the [API documentaiton](https://godoc.org/github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector-go) for more information.
